5 : No heated discussions will be tolerated. If you witness one, please contact an Administrator.
6 : Learn Java before you ask why your code doesn't work. By not learning Java, you make it harder for both yourself and for us. Explaining how to fix something is significantly more difficult if someone hasn't learned java, so please, just take a week or so out of your time to do that first.
7 : Do not be rude to other users, don't be an asshole and just be nice.
8 : Do not ping whole roles or excessively ping users. Just because you might be fine with it, doesn't mean everyone is, so just keep the pings to a minimum.
